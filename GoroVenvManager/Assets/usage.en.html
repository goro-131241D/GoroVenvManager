<h1>Usage</h1>

<h2>[Tabs]</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create Venv: Create a Venv environment and copy the template.</li>
<li>Global Version: Set the global version.</li>
<li>Local Version: Set the local version.</li>
<li>Install: Install Python.</li>
<li>pyenv: Install the pyenv-win environment.</li>
<li>Settings: Configuration.</li>
<li>Usage: Instructions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>[About Venv Environment]</h2>
<p>
The Venv environment is created in the .venv folder. Although users can usually choose the location freely, this is pre-determined.</br>
Version management is handled using pyenv-win, and virtual environments are created using Venv. These two tools are used together.
</p>

<h2>[Procedure]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set the language in the Settings tab and restart the tool.</li>
<li>For the first time, set up the pyenv-win environment in the "5. pyenv" tab.</li>
<li>Install Python and make it available using the "4. Install" tab.</li>
<li>Set the global version in the "2. Global Version" tab. "Global" means it can be used regardless of the folder.</li>
<li>Set the local version in the "3. Local Version" tab. "Local" means it is valid only within the folder.</li>
<li>Create a Venv environment in the specified folder and copy the specified template folder using the "Create Venv" tab.</li>
</ul>

<h2>[Version Confirmation]</h2>
<p>
    You can check the installed versions using `pyenv versions`.</br>
    If there is no active version set: Nothing will be displayed, or the downloaded versions will be shown.</br>
    If the global version is active: `pyenv version` will display the version number followed by the location of the `version` file within the `.pyenv` folder. Example: "* 3.12.5 (set by C:\Users\UserName\.pyenv\pyenv-win\version)"</br>
    If the local version is active: the version number will be followed by the location of the `.python-version` file.
</p>
<h3>Example of a Local Version Being Set</h3>
<p class="monospace">
    PS C:\Users\UserName\TestFolder> pyenv versions<br/>
    3.11.9<br/>
    3.12.3<br/>
  * 3.12.4 (set by C:\Users\UserName\TestFolder\<span class="highlight">.python-version</span>)<br/>
    3.12.5<br/>
</p>
<p>The .python-version file has been created in the local folder. It can also be created in a parent folder, in which case it will be effective for all folders under that parent folder.</p>

<h3>Example of a Global Version Being Set</h3>
<p class="monospace">
    PS C:\Users\UserName\TestFolder> pyenv versions<br/>
    3.11.9<br/>
  * 3.12.3 (set by C:\Users\UserName\<span class="highlight">.pyenv\pyenv-win\version</span>)<br/>
    3.12.4<br/>
    3.12.5<br/>
</p>
<p>The version file is recorded in the version file inside the .pyenv folder. The .pyenv folder contains the necessary files for pyenv and the installed Python versions.</p>

<h3>Example Where Neither Global Nor Local Version is Set</h3>
<p class="monospace">
    PS C:\Users\UserName\TestFolder> pyenv versions<br/>
    3.11.9<br/>
    3.12.3<br/>
    3.12.4<br/>
    3.12.5<br/>
</p>
<p>Nothing is displayed next to the versions. In this case, please note that <span class="highlight">Python installed via pyenv-win cannot be used.</span></p>

<h2>[Details]</h2>
<p>
Version management and Venv environment creation are done using pyenv-win and python -m venv .venv.</br>
This tool does not directly manage versions or virtual environments.</br>
You can also perform these tasks directly from the command prompt without using this tool.</br>
This is a simple support tool. Messages from the commands are displayed on the screen, so please check the messages to confirm if installations, etc., were completed successfully.</br>
The input data type is not checked. Please enter the correct data.</br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>1. Create Venv: Create a Venv environment and copy the template</h3>
Select the folder to create the Venv environment, select the template, and click the "Create" button to create the Venv environment.</br>
A template is a collection of useful files when programming.</br>
The templates are in the templates folder in the folder where this program is stored.</br>
You can create your own template by changing the folder name or the files inside it.</br>
Note that it can only be created in an empty folder, considering overwriting. If there are necessary files, please move them elsewhere before creating.</br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>2. Global Version: Set the global version</h3>
The global version is a version that can be used regardless of the folder.</br>
Set and use a convenient version.</br>
Since there are frequent version updates, download and use the new version each time.</br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>3. Local Version: Set the local version</h3>
The local version is a version that is valid only within the folder.</br>
When developing, you may need to change the version for each project.</br>
This is when you use it.</br>
The selectable versions will be displayed when you either choose a folder by clicking the "Select" button or press the "Set" button.</br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>4. Install: Install Python</h3>
Use this when there is a version update or when you want to use a special version.</br>
There is no uninstall function in this tool. Please do it from the command.</br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>5. pyenv: Install the pyenv-win environment</h3>
Use this the first time and when upgrading pyenv-win.</br>
When upgrading, delete the .pyenv folder in the user folder and then run it.</br>
Note that in this case, the installed Python versions will also be deleted.</br>
Alternatively, you can update from the command.</br>
An update feature might be added in the future.</br>
</p>
<p>
<h3>6. Settings: Configuration</h3>
Set the language in the Languages option. It will take effect after restarting the tool.</br>
Set the base folder in the BaseFolder option to make folder selection operations easier.
</p>
<p>
<h3>7. Usage: Instructions</h3>
</p>
<h2>【Issues】</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>When the Python version that can be used to create a venv is not set, an error occurs, but it is difficult to recognize.</li>
<li>It does not support updates of pyenv-win.</li>
<li>Some parts that should have flexibility in settings are hard-coded.</li>
<li>It is difficult to distinguish whether it is set locally or globally.</li>
</ul>
There may be other improvements needed, but please bear with us.
